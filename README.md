# Rokt Integration Demo App Using React
This demo app shows how Rokt can be integrated using React's Context API. After fetching available offers from a single /experiences call, it renders a Rokt Layout into one of 3 div elements on the `<Consumer/>` component.

`npm run start` to start dev server and view the app.
